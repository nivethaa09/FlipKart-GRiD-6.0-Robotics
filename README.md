# Smart Quality Test System for E-commerce Using Camera Vision Technology


To design and implement a mobile-based camera vision system for e-commerce that automates product 
quality testing by extracting relevant information, validating expiration dates, detecting product freshness, 
and counting the products accurately

## Features

- **Product Description**: Extracts text from images using OCR to provide details such as product name, brand, etc.
- **Product Count**: Detects and counts the number of products in an image using Object Detection.
- **Freshness Detection**: Analyzes the freshness of perishable items (e.g., fruits or vegetables) using a trained model.
- **Brand Recognition**: Recognizes the brand of a product and alerts the user if the brand appears to be counterfeit or fake.
